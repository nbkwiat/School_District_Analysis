# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of School District Analysis
For this analysis, I was tasked with finding multiple key metrics to determine what is a cause of a schools success or failure. After discovering some academic dishonesty. I was tasked with altering the data to match the actual metrics. 

## Results

### How is the district summary affected? 
In the district there was a total of 15 schools with 39,170 children. Looking at the results in the image below, we can see that the average math and reading scores were above passing but in the overall percent of students passing it was only 64.9%. Lets take a further look at why this might be.

### How is the school summary affected?
Looking at the top five and bottom 5 schools there is only a few noticible differences.
  - Charter schools did significantly better than District schools.
  - The bottom five schools math scores were all averaging in the 60% range which means most people struggled with math.
  - Budget seems to have little no no influence on score numbers.
  - It appears that the fewer number of students in the school contributed to higher test scores.
  - all grades held steady averages 9th-12th grade.

### Top/Bottom 5 schools

### How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
#### Math and Reading scores

Looking at the average math and reading scores above, We can see that replacing the 9th grade scores from Thomas High School had little affect on their strong performance as a school.

#### Scores by school spending

Looking at the image above we can see that Thomas High School's budget was realatively low compared to some of the other schools and they still were able to have strong passing percentages.

#### Scores by school size

We can see from the image above that small to medium schools have a higher overall passing percentage than larger schools, which are mostly district. 

#### Scores by school type

Looking at the image above we can see that charter schools had much higher schools than district schools. This could be due to student size and being private having more flexability to allocate money.
 
## Summary
Overall it appears that replacing the scores for Thomas High School had little change on the overall outcome. On the math and reading the averages only changed by a fraction of a percentage point. It did lower the per student budget by a few dollars which doesnt seem to affect the outcome. I believe they did better because they were a charter school and had a lower student population.
